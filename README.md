 Plant Disease Detection
A deep learning-based approach to identifying plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

 Overview
This project classifies plant diseases using a CNN model trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased plant images. It leverages image preprocessing, data augmentation, and deep learning techniques to improve accuracy.

 Dataset
Contains images of healthy and diseased plants.
Augmented using rotation, flipping, and normalization.
Dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

 Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
Model: CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
