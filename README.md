Plant Disease Detection
This project detects plant diseases using Deep Learning (CNNs) and TensorFlow. It utilizes an augmented dataset of plant images to classify diseases effectively.

Dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

Project Details
Dataset: Contains healthy and diseased plant images with multiple classes.
Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224, augmented with rotation, flips, and rescaling.
Data Loading: Uses ImageDataGenerator to prepare training, validation, and test sets.
Model Training: CNN will be trained to classify plant diseases accurately.

Next Steps
 Implement CNN Model
 Evaluate Performance (Accuracy, Loss)
 Try Transfer Learning (EfficientNet, MobileNet)
